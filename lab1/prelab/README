Available rules:
make run		- Runs A/fstI/fstG.py for the full extent of the dictionaries
make sample		- Runs A/fstI/fstG.py for the first 80 words
make compile		- Compiles all FSTs and FSAs
make draw		- Creates a pdf representation of the FSTs/FSAs
make clean		- Deletes everything created from the previous commands

Running the project:
1. make run/sample 	- Use sample for demonstration purposes.
2. make compile 	- Compile the needed binary FSs.
3. make draw		- Recommended use only with make sample.

It is reasonable that `make draw` will not work if `make run` was executed in the first step due to the enormous amount of states in the FSAs.
